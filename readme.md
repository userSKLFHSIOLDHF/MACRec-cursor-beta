    - `systems/`: The multi-agent system classes are defined here.
        - `base.py`: The base system class.
        - `collaboration.py`: The collaboration system class. **We recommend using this class for most of the tasks.**
        - `analyse.py`: ***(Deprecated)*** The system with a *Manager* and an *Analyst*. Do not support the `chat` task.
        - `chat.py`: ***(Deprecated)*** The system with a *Manager*, a *Searcher*, and a *Task Interpreter*. Only support the `chat` task.
        - `react.py`: ***(Deprecated)*** The system with a single *Manager*. Do not support the `chat` task.
        - `reflection.py`: ***(Deprecated)*** The system with a *Manager* and a *Reflector*. Do not support the `chat` task.
    - `tasks/`: For external function calls (e.g. main.py). **Note needs to be distinguished from recommended tasks.**
        - `base.py`: The base task class.
        - `calculate.py`: The task for calculating the metrics.
        - `chat.py`: The task for chatting with the `ChatSystem`.
        - **`evaluate.py`**: The task for evaluating the system on the rating prediction or sequence recommendation tasks. The task is inherited from `generation.py`.
        - `feedback.py`: The task for selecting the feedback for the *Reflector*. The task is inherited from `generation.py`.
        - `generation.py`: The basic task for generating the answers from a dataset.
        - `preprocess.py`: The task for preprocessing the dataset.
        - **`pure_generation.py`**: The task for generating the answers from a dataset without any evaluation. The task is inherited from `generation.py`.
        - `reward_update.py`: The task for calculating the reward function for the RLHF.
        - `rlhf.py`: The task for training the *Reflector* with the PPO algorithm.
        - `sample.py`: The task for sampling from the dataset.
        - `test.py`: The task for evaluating the system on few-shot data samples. The task is inherited from `evaluate.py`.
    - `utils/`: Some useful functions are defined here.
- `config/`: The config folder.
    - `api-config.json`: Used for OpenAI-like APIs' configuration. We give an example for the configuration, named `api-config-example.json`.

        - `task_agent_prompt/`: ***(Deprecated)*** The task-specific prompts for agents in other systems.
    - `systems/`: The configuration for each system. Every system has a configuration folder.
    - `tools/`: The configuration for each tool.
    - `training/`: Some configuration for the PPO or other RL algorithms training.

- `data/`: The dataset folder which contains both the raw and preprocessed data.
- `log/`: The log folder.
- `run/`: The evaluation result folder.
- `scripts/`: Some useful scripts.

### Setup the environment

0. Make sure the python version is greater than or equal to 3.10.13. We do not test the code on other versions.

1. Run the following commands to install PyTorch (Note: change the URL setting if using another version of CUDA):
    ```shell
    pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    ```
2. Run the following commands to install dependencies:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the following commands to download and preprocess the dataset (including `ml-100k` and `Amazon Beauty`):
   ```shell
   bash ./scripts/preprocess.sh
   ```

### Run with the command line

Use the following to run specific tasks:
```shell
python main.py -m $task_name --verbose $verbose $extra_args
```

Then `main.py` will run the `${task_name}Task` defined in `macrec/tasks/*.py`.

E.g., to evaluate the sequence recommendation task in MovieLens-100k dataset for the `CollaborationSystem` with *Reflector*, *Analyst*, and *Searcher*, just run:
```shell
python main.py --main Evaluate --data_file data/ml-100k/test.csv --system collaboration --system_config config/systems/collaboration/reflect_analyse_search.json --task sr
```

You can refer to the `scripts/` folder for some useful scripts.

### Run with the web demo

Use the following to run the web demo:
```shell
streamlit run web_demo.py
```

Then open the browser and visit `http://localhost:8501/` to use the web demo.

Please note that the systems utilizing open-source LLMs or other language models may require a significant amount of memory. These systems have been disabled on machines without CUDA support.
